description: The original 'Black Caesar' was a legendary African pirate who made his
  fortune by repeatedly raiding cargo ships in the area around the Florida Keys. In
  this imaginative novel from popular American author Albert Payson Terhune, the fearsome
  pirate's descendents are determined to find his buried loot -- and to run off any
  interlopers who might be after the same prize.
